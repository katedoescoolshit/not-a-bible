# Not A Bible - Project Brief

## Mission Statement

**They can't delete what you already have.**

Create a fully offline-capable, static HTML Bible designed for digital preservation and unrestricted access in an era where religious content is increasingly restricted or removed from digital platforms.

## Problem Statement

- Countries are banning or restricting Bible access
- Digital platforms can remove content at will
- Apps require internet, accounts, and platform approval
- Websites can go offline or be blocked
- Access to scripture is becoming increasingly controlled

## Solution

A dual-format Bible distribution system:

1. **Next.js Marketing Site** - Online presence for discovery and download
2. **Static HTML Bible** - Fully offline, zero-dependency scripture reader

## Core Values

- **Preservation** - Built to last decades, not years
- **Accessibility** - Works anywhere, on any device
- **Freedom** - No tracking, no accounts, no restrictions
- **Shareability** - Designed to be copied and distributed freely
- **Permanence** - No dependencies that can break or expire

## Target Users

1. **Primary**: People in regions with restricted religious freedom
2. **Secondary**: Missionaries with unreliable internet
3. **Tertiary**: Churches wanting to host scripture independently
4. **General**: Anyone who values digital ownership and preservation

## Success Metrics

- Number of downloads
- Geographic distribution
- Offline usage (via localStorage analytics if user opts in)
- Community contributions (translations, features)
- Hosting instances (people self-hosting)

## Technical Philosophy

- **No frameworks that expire** - Pure HTML/CSS/JS for the Bible reader
- **Modern stack for marketing** - Next.js for the landing site
- **Public domain content** - KJV initially, more translations later
- **Zero surveillance** - No tracking, no analytics (unless user opts in)
- **Maximum portability** - Single file distribution possible

## Project Status

**Phase**: Initial Setup
**Current**: Creating project structure and documentation
**Next**: Build Next.js landing site and populate Bible data

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Project setup, documentation, structure
- **Week 2**: Next.js landing site development
- **Week 3**: Bible data population (KJV)
- **Week 4**: Testing, optimization, deployment
- **Ongoing**: Additional translations, features, community

## Resources Needed

- Bible data sources (KJV public domain)
- Hosting (Vercel/Netlify for Next.js)
- Domain name (optional but recommended)
- Community contributors (translations, testing)

## Distribution Strategy

1. **Direct Download** - ZIP file from website
2. **GitHub Releases** - Version-controlled releases
3. **Physical Media** - USB drives, CDs for offline distribution
4. **Self-Hosting** - Instructions for personal hosting
5. **Mirrors** - Community-hosted mirrors for redundancy

## Legal Considerations

- KJV is public domain (published before 1923)
- Open source license (MIT or similar)
- No copyright restrictions on distribution
- Encourage copying and sharing

## Future Enhancements

- Additional translations (ASV, WEB, etc.)
- Search functionality improvements
- Study notes and cross-references
- Audio Bible integration
- Mobile app wrapper (optional)
- Offline-first PWA version
- Multi-language interface
