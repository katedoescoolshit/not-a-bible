## Launch Day Strategy

### Hour 0: The Drop

**Product Hunt Launch**
```
Title: "Not A Bible - The offline Bible that can't be deleted"

Tagline: "12 MB. Zero dependencies. Works forever. Digital preservation is resistance."

First Comment (from you):
"Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built this because countries are banning Bible access and apps can be removed at any time. This is a fully offline Bible that:

- Works without internet (forever)
- Requires no account or login
- Is only 12 MB (entire Bible)
- Will still work in 20 years
- Can be freely copied and shared

It's not just a Bible app. It's a digital preservation project.

The static Bible is pure HTML/CSS/JS with zero dependencies. The landing site is Next.js. Both are open source.

Would love your feedback! 🙏"

Media:
- Hero screenshot
- Demo GIF (offline functionality)
- Comparison chart (us vs. others)
- Video demo (2 min)
```

**Hacker News Post**
```
Title: "Not A Bible – Offline Bible reader with zero dependencies"

URL: [Your site]

Comment (if needed):
"Author here. Built this as a digital preservation project. Countries are restricting Bible access, so I made one that can't be deleted.

Pure HTML/CSS/JS for the reader (no frameworks), Next.js for the landing site. Entire Bible is 12 MB and works completely offline.

The goal isn't to compete with Bible apps. It's to make scripture indestructible through distributed preservation.

Happy to answer questions!"
```

### Hour 1-2: Social Media Blitz

**Twitter/X Thread**
```
🧵 I built an offline Bible that can't be deleted. Here's why:

1/ Countries are banning Bible access. Apps are being removed. Websites are being blocked. Digital access to scripture is increasingly controlled.

2/ So I built something different. Not a Bible app. Not a Bible website. A digital preservation project.

3/ It's a fully offline Bible reader:
- 12 MB (entire Bible)
- Zero dependencies
- Works without internet
- No account needed
- Will work in 20 years

4/ The tech is deliberately simple:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- No external API calls
- No database required
- No build process needed
- Just open index.html

5/ Why? Because frameworks go obsolete. APIs shut down. Servers go offline. But HTML from 1995 still works today.

6/ This isn't about features. It's about permanence. It's about ownership. It's about making scripture indestructible.

7/ You can:
- Download it (12 MB)
- Copy it to USB
- Email it
- Host it yourself
- Share it freely
- It's designed to spread

8/ The goal: Create a distributed preservation network. Thousands of mirrors. Impossible to shut down. Impossible to censor.

9/ Digital preservation is resistance. They can't delete what you already have.

10/ Check it out: [link]
Open source: [GitHub link]

Join the movement. Help make scripture indestructible. 🙏

I just launched "Not A Bible" - a digital preservation project for scripture.

The problem: Countries are restricting Bible access. Apps can be removed. Websites can be blocked. Digital access is controlled.

The solution: A fully offline Bible that can't be deleted.

Technical approach:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (zero dependencies)
- 12 MB total size
- Works completely offline
- Will function for decades
- Designed for distribution

This isn't about building the best Bible app. It's about digital preservation as resistance.

The code is open source. The content is public domain. The mission is preservation.

r/Christianity:
```
Title: "I built an offline Bible for countries where access is restricted"

Body:
"Hey everyone,

I've been concerned about increasing restrictions on Bible access in various countries, so I built something to help: a fully offline Bible reader that can't be deleted or blocked.

Key features:
- Works completely offline (no internet needed)
- Only 12 MB (entire Bible)
- No account or login required
- Free and open source
- Can be copied and shared freely

It's designed for:
- People in countries with restricted access
- Missionaries with unreliable internet
- Anyone who values digital ownership
- Churches wanting to host scripture independently

The tech is deliberately simple (pure HTML/CSS/JS) so it will work for decades without breaking.

Would love your feedback and help spreading this to those who need it.

Title: "Not A Bible - Zero-dependency offline Bible reader (HTML/CSS/JS)"

Body:
"Built a digital preservation project for scripture with an interesting technical approach:

Static Bible Reader:
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- Zero external dependencies
- Works completely offline
- 12 MB total size
- Will function for decades

Landing Site:
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Deployed on Vercel
- Handles downloads and distribution

The goal is digital preservation through distributed hosting. Making scripture indestructible by making it easy to copy, host, and share.

Tech stack choices were deliberate - no frameworks that can go obsolete, no APIs that can shut down, no dependencies that can break.

Open source, public domain content (KJV), designed to be forked and modified.

Feedback welcome!

With increasing restrictions on Bible access in various countries, I built a fully offline Bible reader that:

Subject: Story idea: Digital preservation as resistance

Hi [Name],

I recently launched "Not A Bible" - a digital preservation project that's getting traction in the open source community.

The angle: As countries increasingly restrict Bible access, this project makes scripture indestructible through distributed preservation.

The tech is interesting (zero-dependency architecture designed to last decades), but the story is about digital ownership and resistance to censorship.

Would this be interesting for [publication]?

Happy to provide more details or arrange an interview.
